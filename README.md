# Sharify Backend

This is the [Sharify](https://github.com/Snoupix/Sharify) backend that will handle the app's logic with HTTP & Websocket endpoints using Protobuf and JSON for message encoding/decoding.

This project was originially from a private API but I chose to make the Sharify part public to showcase another Rust project of mine (and also for curious people). This is in WIP because there is a lot to rework since I was using GraphQL at first, alongside Websockets with an Actor-model/pattern. GQL was an mistake for this app so I'm remaking everything from scratch.
